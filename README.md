# projects
# There are 7 folders.


# CSE215 / CSE222 / CSE224 , They are based on C.

    #   However, two of them in CSE224 are bash based code.
    #   These programs were mainly designed in Linux System.
    #   Some of programs would be able to be compiled with "makefile"  (mostly in CSE222 programs)
            user can compile the program with typing this below command
                - >     "make"           // compile the programs to be excutable 
                - >     "make clean"     // delete an excutable file (not deleted origin files)
    # For bash programs(pa1 and pa3 in CSE224), they should be compiled in Linux server with this below command.
                - >     "chmod 755 codename"
                - >     can run by typing "./filename"

# CSE223 is Java based code.

     # in the Java projects folder, Eclipse is mainly used for these programs.
     # In each folder, I put source codes(format : ~~~.java) and zip folder.
                    # zip folder would be able to be imported into Eclipse and to be runable in Eclipse.
      
      ## Should know ## #before using Ecplise to run a program#
      ## sometimes a program cannot be runable because of "package". It should be made as "default".
      
      ## Ther is a folder (Labs 1-4)
            ## This is Lab reports and Raspberry pi was dealt with in each Lab.
            ## In the report, there are some codes and explanation of this.
      
 # In PersonalProject
      ## It is Java game. It is called Tic Tac Toe.
      ## It is based on JPanel and JFrame.
      ## "Tic Tac Toe" is easy to design if a user uses switch. But I used "Graphics"
      ## I designed this program in Eclipse.
      
      
  # ENGR 250 Digital Logic Design && ENGR 270 Digital System and Micro.
      ## There are all lap report and pdf format. Codes are also included.
